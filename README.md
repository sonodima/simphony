# Simphony

Customize your carrier name, signal strength, and network type—because why not?

## Features

**Fake Carrier Name** • Miss the good ol’ days of Sprint? Now’s your chance to bring it back, even if only for nostalgia’s sake.

**Spoof Network Type / Signal Strength** • 4G on iPod? No one?

**Silence "No SIM" Alerts** •  Arguably the only real QoL improvement here.

## Support

Simphony works seamlessly on all iOS devices, including non-cellular ones like iPods and WiFi-only iPads.

I've personally tested it from iOS `6.0.0` to `10.3.4`.

**NOTE:** On iOS 7, PreferenceLoader seems to have some issues. Changes may require a manual respring to apply. Good luck!

## Why

Because sometimes you do things for no solid reason--and that's perfectly fine.

Maybe you just like the idea of a tweak that does this. No need to justify it.

## Credits

The `SIM Alert Suppression` feature is borrowed from the tweak of the same name. If that’s all you need, consider using the original tweak instead.
